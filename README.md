# Machine-Learning-Week-2
I wanted to avoid writing a for-loop for the optional featureNormalizing exercise. Used the repmat functions in Matlab to do this.

For the mandatory part, I also wrote code snippets  to i) abort if cost-functions started to rise ii) abort if change in cost functions was less than or equal to 0.001%
