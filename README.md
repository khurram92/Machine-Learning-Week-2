# Machine-Learning-Week-2
I wanted to avoid writing a for-loop for the optional featureNormalizing exercise. Hence I used the repmat functions in Matlab to do this.

For the mandatory exercise (gradientDescent.m), I wrote code snippets  to i) abort if cost-functions started to rise, and ii) end optimization if change in cost function was less than or equal to 0.001%
